You need `ansible-test` to run tests.
(It's available with ansible from pypi/pip. Many distribution, like Ubuntu and Debian
do not ship it in system package).

There are two scenarios for test: CI and 'docker-priveleged'. For docker-priveleged scenario
you need to have docker on VM you can discard (reboot) after tests.

To run test make venv with ansible 2.9.something and run 
```
ansible-test integration --python 3.8 ip_link_device --allow-root --docker --docker-privileged
```
from ansible_collections/amarao/ip directory.
